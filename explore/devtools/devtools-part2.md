1. The bug was in the function ```calculateSum()```, specifically it was due to the parameters ```num1``` and ```num2``` that are considered as string data type and the ```+``` operator is concatenating them instead of adding them mathematically, resulting in the ```result``` variable being treated as the ```string``` data type.
2. I fixed this bug by using the unary plus operator ```+```, which help to convert the strings to numbers. I put that operator infront of the variable ```num1``` and ```num2``` at the initialization of local variable ```result``` to convert ```num1``` and ```num2``` to numbers, allowing the proper addition process to happen and store the outcome in the ```result``` variable.
